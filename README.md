# Officer Package Tutorial

Materials from my [`officer`](https://davidgohel.github.io/officer/) package tutorial at the 2019 `rstudio::conf` [Advanced R-Markdown workshop](http://arm.rbind.io/). You can view the slides at [rpodcast.github.io/officer-advrmarkdown](https://rpodcast.github.io/officer-advrmarkdown).
